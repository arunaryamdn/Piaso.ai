Known Issues

1. SSL Certificate Issues
   - The application uses Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch stock data
   - Some users may experience SSL certificate errors
   - The app automatically attempts to use certifi package to resolve these issues
   - For problematic stocks, the app will try to use BSE data when NSE data is unavailable
   - If certain stocks don't load, try changing the stock symbol to use '.BO' suffix instead of '.NS'

2. Data Fetching
   - Some stocks might not be available through Yahoo Finance
   - In such cases, the app will attempt to fetch data from alternative sources
   - If data is still unavailable, those stocks will be marked with a warning
